## Usage:
#### To start:
- Run o.c.cpp file.
- ```1``` To start Words to Symbols.
- ```2``` To start Symbols to Words.
#### Words to Symbols:
If input is:
```
Hello_World
```
Then output is:
```
}}}>>>>.].}>>.}>>.}]..}}}}]>>>>.}].}]>>>.}>>.>>>>.
```
---
If input is:
```
a1_B2_c3_D4_e5
```
Then output is:
```
>.<<..}}]>>>.<<<..>>>.<<<<..}}}.[..].[<.
```
#### Symbols to Words:
If input is:
```
}}}>>>>.].}>>.}>>.}]..}}}}]>>>>.}].}]>>>.}>>.>>>>.
```
Then output is:
```
Hello World
```
---
If input is:
```
>.<<..}}]>>>.<<<..>>>.<<<<..}}}.[..].[<.
